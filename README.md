Hi everyone! I'm Pook or you can call me Supakorn Siripisitwong. I'm studying in faculty of Industrial Technology and Management at King Mongkut's University Of Technology North Bangkok Prachinburi Campus(KMUTNB). My English skill is now improving. If I'm wrongs with grammar, please advices me. I love coding iOS Native. This is because, it is easily to drag a component in Storyboard, easily to set constraints, and easily to read, understand for Swift language.

The reason is to learn the creating process of the famous application. I had gained many experences for creating InstaYam project. For example, how to setup constraints, how to use TableView, how to use CollectionView, how to use custom class in storyboard or XIB, how to use custom cell when creating TableView or CollectionView, how to call endpoint with URLSession, how to make the clean code by using CleanSwift architecture, how to create custom tabbars, and how to create Extension of UIKIT such as UITextField, UIImageView, UIViewController, UIView.
